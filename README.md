## Web Paint

#### Description
A web app that enables users to draw on the screen. Utilizes canvas elements to handle the drawing.


#### Goals
May eventually make use of webassembly for something?


#### ToDo
* Create the color picker-
    * Make it square
    * Add a border to the selected color
    * Add a div that shows HSB of that color

* Enable drawing on the main canvas with selected color

* Tools: 
    * Brush tool (size, shape, style)
    * Eraser tool (size, shape)
    * Clear all
    * Print

IDK how webassembly would fit into this- maybe enable uploading of another drawing and webassembly handles 
rendering it to the screen?
